# Typo
A .NET-based application for practicing blind and/or fast typing for the Object-Oriented Software Design &amp; Development semester of Windesheim University of Applied Sciences (22/23). 

This repository is not the original one used for development, and is merely here so that I have a copy of the codebase on my own account. The original development repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Student-Nathan/OOSDDe5).

## Built with
- .NET 5.0 Framework
- WPF
